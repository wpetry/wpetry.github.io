      <description>The rarity of one sex can have profound ecological and evolutionary impacts on populations â€“ ranging from mate limitation, loss of genetic diversity, and altered regimes of sexual selection. These population changes may also affect other species by altering species interactions. Despite widespread evidence of skewed sex ratios across the tree of life, we rarely understand their causes and consequences.
Populations of the long-lived montane herb Valeriana edulis (Caprifoliaceae) are increasingly female-biased across its 2000 m elevation range.</description>

Process-level ecological data is usually collected locally, making scaling to the landscape and global scale a dubious exercise. I&amp;rsquo;m collborating with two projects that seek to remedy this deficiency by using global distributed experiments.
Geographic gradients in species interactions Species diversity generally increases towards the Equator, and the extent to which this affects species interactions will have profound biogeographic and evolutionary consequences.</description>

      <description>In addition to building demographic models and parameterizing them with field data, I am a member of the Science Committee for the twin databases of matrix population models, COMPADRE and COMADRE. Our goal is to enable comparative demographic studies by assembling a comprehensive database of demographic models and their associated metadata, then making it publicly available along with tools to work with the data.
See our blog for highlights of recent papers that have resulted from this effort, or download the latest versions of each dataset here.</description>
