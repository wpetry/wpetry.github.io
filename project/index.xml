      <description>How do so many types of organisms persist on a small number of shared resources? Organisms compete with their neighbors&amp;ndash;both individuals of the same and different species–-for resources. Through recent theoretical and empirical advances, we&amp;rsquo;ve come to understand the mechanisms that maintain the incredible diversity of species that we observe in competitive communities. However, these competitor species are themselves resources for consumers, and many hypotheses for the origin of diversity depend.</description>

      <title>Two-sex population dynamics</title>

      <description>The rarity of one sex can have profound ecological and evolutionary impacts on populations – ranging from mate limitation, loss of genetic diversity, and altered regimes of sexual selection. These population changes may also affect other species by altering species interactions. Despite widespread evidence of skewed sex ratios across the tree of life, we rarely understand their causes and consequences.
Populations of the long-lived montane herb Valeriana edulis (Caprifoliaceae) are increasingly female-biased across its 2000 m elevation range.</description>

Process-level ecological data is usually collected locally, making scaling to the landscape and global scale a dubious exercise. I&amp;rsquo;m collborating with two projects that seek to remedy this deficiency by using global distributed experiments.
Geographic gradients in species interactions Species diversity generally increases towards the Equator, and the extent to which this affects species interactions will have profound biogeographic and evolutionary consequences.</description>

      <title>Drivers of species interactions</title>

      <description>Temporal dynamics of species interaction networks Make a list of species that occur in a given place, and only a fraction of the potential interaction links between species will ever occur. Building and analyzing these interaction networks has substantially advanced our understanding of community structure, function, and stability. Because the forces that control species&amp;rsquo; abundances and behaviors, it follows that these links&amp;ndash;and their ecological and evolutionary consequences&amp;ndash;may vary in space and time.</description>

      <title>Comparative demography</title>

      <description>In addition to building demographic models and parameterizing them with field data, I am a member of the Science Committee for the twin databases of matrix population models, COMPADRE and COMADRE. Our goal is to enable comparative demographic studies by assembling a comprehensive database of demographic models and their associated metadata, then making it publicly available along with tools to work with the data.
See our blog for highlights of recent papers that have resulted from this effort, or download the latest versions of each dataset here.</description>
